# Analysing and Visualising AVL and GTFS data with R
The aim of this project was to investigate the potential benefits big data can lend to public transport systems. Specifically the investigations involved utilising the statistical programming language R to process and analyse publicly available data sets relating to the Dublin Bus system. The graphical visualisation of the Dublin Bus system with R was alas also investigated.

The project was carried out as part of my undergraduate course work for a 4th year module called Emerging Technologies. The goal of the module was to investigate some emerging technology that I had not otherwise formally studied. Hypothesis where then proposed and tested via a software artefact. 

My two hypothesis where as follows: 
<ol>
<li>Big data can be used to identify weaknesses in public transportation systems.</li>
<li>Geospatial data can be graphically represented with the with the R Programming Language
and Software Environment for Statistical Computing.‚Äù.</li>
</ol>

The AVL data set I used can be found <a href="http://dublinked.com/datastore/datasets/dataset-304.php">here</a>.

The GTFS data set I used can be found <a href="http://dublinked.com/datastore/datasets/dataset-254.php">here</a>.

The main.R script contains all the R code used to pre-process, analyse then visualise the the data using GGPlot2.
The final.pdf file document the entire project more thouroughly.
